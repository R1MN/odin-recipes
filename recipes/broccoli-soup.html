    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute
        onion and celery until tender. Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer
        for 10 minutes.
      </li>

      <br />

      <li>
        Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway
        full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and
        carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup
        moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and
        pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and
        puree the soup right in the cooking pot.
      </li>

      <br />

      <li>
        Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low
        heat; stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add
        to soup. Season with pepper and serve.
